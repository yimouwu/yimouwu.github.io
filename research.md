# Research Experience

## Model Predictive Control (MPC) Development for Robot Manipulators

**Undergraduate Research Assistant**  
**Supervisor**: Prof. Huihuan Qian  
**Sep. 2022 - Present**  
Shenzhen, China

- Combined MATLAB with CoppeliaSim to implement MPC-based joint control for a robotic arm and UAV.
- Improved the robotic arm’s grasping algorithm, increasing precision by approximately 10%.
- Conducted literature reviews on robotic arms to propose innovative ideas for advancing kinematic control.
- Achieved high-precision docking and seamless object handoffs between the robotic arm, UAV, and vessel.
